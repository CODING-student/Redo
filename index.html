    <p>Because of COVID-19 all students have to take a daily screen testing and without it they arent allowed into the building. After let inside, students must take a temperature reading. If the temperature is ove 100 degrees farenheit, they have to leave. And even after that, while waiting on line, every student must social distance each other. Including the fact that everyone in the building must wear masks. If anyone in a class has been tested positive, the entire class will be quarantined home for avout 10 days.</p>
